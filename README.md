## Technologies used
*<span style="color: green">**The front end**</span> uses <span style="color: green">**VueJs**</span> (The powerful framework) with its dependencies and libraries. I have chosen VueJs for it is easiness and tidiness and for the performance and the short response time with end-user.*
*I used <span style="color: pink">**Firebase** as the backend of my application</span>. Its features cannot be compared to other backend services. it is so powerful, secure, easy to use and provides tons of services. Here are the full list of the used technologies:*
* Frontend
    *  VueJs framework :heavy_check_mark:
    *  Bootstrap :heavy_check_mark:
    *  BootstrapVue :heavy_check_mark:
* Backend
    * Google Firebase :heavy_check_mark:
    * VueFirestore :heavy_check_mark:
    * Google-cloud functions :heavy_check_mark:
    * NodeJs :heavy_check_mark:
    * Stripe payments :warning:

## Note :warning::
Stripe is setup but my firebase needs a subscription and I have issues with it. So,<span style="color: red"> it is not functioning at the moment.
</span>
